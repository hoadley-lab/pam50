Description: Assigns research-based PAM50 molecular subtypes using gene expression from breast cancer tumor samples. This consists of: (1) reading/parsing an input file; (2) optionally imputing missing values; (3) centering PAM50 gene expression levels using median counts (self) or with a pre-defined set of values; and (4) assignment subtypes based on the most highly correlated subtype centroid from pre-existing training data.
